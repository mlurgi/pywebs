# pywebs
A Python library for food web analysis

Author: Miguel Lurgi

Developed at the **Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF), Barcelona, Spain**

This library was developed to analyse the food webs of the vertebrate communities in mountain ecosystems of the Pyrenees through time to determine the effects of climate warming on food web structure. The results of this study was published in:

Lurgi M, López BC & Montoya JM (2012) Climate change impacts on body size and food web structure on mountain ecosystems. ***Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B*** 367, 3050–3057.

To use the library import the 'web' module and read the documentation of each function in there for specific details.
